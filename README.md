# Project: Clean Code React Books

## Project Overview

This project aims to demonstrate how to progressively transform code written in React using poor practices into more readable, efficient, and understandable code. The project is divided into several branches, each representing different stages of refactoring. You can follow the changes from the initial, non-optimal code to the final version that adheres to best coding practices.

## Branch Structure

- **`01-employee-crud`** - The initial branch containing the base code written with poor practices. This is the starting point for the refactoring process.
- **Additional branches** - Further branches demonstrating the refactoring steps will be added soon.
